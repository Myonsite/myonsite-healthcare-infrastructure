# Junior Developer Guide - AI-Managed Healthcare Development

## 🎯 Overview

This guide provides a complete framework for junior developers with zero experience to successfully build healthcare applications using the MedinovAI AI-managed infrastructure. The AI agents handle 90% of the technical complexity while you focus on business logic and user experience.

## 🚀 Step-by-Step Development Process

### Phase 1: Project Setup (Week 1)

#### Step 1.1: Create Project Structure
```bash
# Create your project directory
mkdir healthcare-projects
cd healthcare-projects

# Create your specific use case directory
mkdir clinical-trials
cd clinical-trials

# Use the AI infrastructure to set up the project
make dev-up
```

#### Step 1.2: Define Requirements (AI-Assisted)
Create `requirements/user-stories.md`:
```markdown
# Clinical Trial Management - User Stories

## As a Clinical Research Coordinator
- I want to register patients for clinical trials
- I want to track patient progress through trial phases
- I want to generate compliance reports for FDA

## As a Principal Investigator
- I want to review trial data in real-time
- I want to receive alerts for adverse events
- I want to approve protocol changes

## As a Regulatory Officer
- I want to ensure HIPAA compliance
- I want to validate FDA 21 CFR Part 11 requirements
- I want to audit trial data integrity
```

#### Step 1.3: Configure AI Agents
Create `ai-agents/orchestrator-config.yaml`:
```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: ConfigMap
metadata:
  name: clinical-trial-orchestrator-config
  namespace: ai-agents
data:
  project_type: "clinical_trials"
  compliance_requirements:
    - "FDA_21_CFR_PART_11"
    - "HIPAA"
    - "GCP"
  ai_agents:
    - name: "coding-agent"
      type: "coding"
      replicas: 3
      focus: ["frontend", "backend", "database"]
    - name: "compliance-agent"
      type: "compliance"
      replicas: 2
      focus: ["hipaa", "fda", "audit_trails"]
    - name: "testing-agent"
      type: "testing"
      replicas: 4
      focus: ["unit_tests", "integration_tests", "e2e_tests"]
```

### Phase 2: AI-Powered Development (Weeks 2-4)

#### Step 2.1: Start AI Development
```bash
# Deploy AI agents for your project
kubectl apply -f ai-agents/orchestrator-config.yaml

# Monitor AI agent progress
make mesh-dashboard

# Check AI agent status
kubectl get pods -n ai-agents
```

#### Step 2.2: Review AI-Generated Code
The AI agents will automatically:
- Generate frontend React components
- Create backend API endpoints
- Design database schemas
- Write unit tests
- Implement security measures

**Your Role**: Review and approve the generated code

#### Step 2.3: Customize Business Logic
Focus on business-specific requirements:
```python
# Example: Custom business logic for clinical trials
class ClinicalTrialService:
    def register_patient(self, patient_data):
        # Your custom business logic here
        # AI agents handle the technical implementation
        pass
    
    def track_adverse_event(self, event_data):
        # Your custom business logic here
        # AI agents handle compliance and reporting
        pass
```

### Phase 3: Testing & Quality Assurance (Week 5)

#### Step 3.1: AI-Powered Testing
```bash
# AI agents automatically run comprehensive tests
kubectl logs -n ai-agents deployment/ai-agent-testing

# Review test results
make mesh-dashboard
```

#### Step 3.2: Manual Testing
Focus on user experience testing:
- Test user workflows
- Validate business requirements
- Check user interface usability

#### Step 3.3: Compliance Validation
```bash
# AI compliance agents validate regulatory requirements
kubectl logs -n ai-agents deployment/ai-agent-compliance

# Review compliance reports
kubectl get configmap -n ai-agents compliance-reports
```

### Phase 4: Deployment & Monitoring (Week 6)

#### Step 4.1: Deploy to Production
```bash
# AI agents handle deployment
make ai-agents-scaling

# Monitor deployment
kubectl get pods -A
```

#### Step 4.2: Set Up Monitoring
```bash
# Access monitoring dashboards
make mesh-dashboard

# Check application health
kubectl get services -A
```
